        I'm a Software Engineer working in Infrastructure and Configurations. A
        few years in industry has led me to two truths:
      </p>
      <ul class="page-card-text">
        <li>There is almost never a single solution to a problem.</li>
        <li>
          Experience, product understanding, and communication are needed to
          produce great work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="page-card-text">
        Pursuing the 'perfect' solution means compromising and embracing
        pragmatism. I believe in iterating, improving, and maintaining solutions
        over time. Though, I can adapt as needed.
      </p>

      <p class="page-card-text">
        Ironically, I used to despise programming. My first CS class was junior
        year of high school. It was hard and time-consuming at first. Yet, when
        the foreign became the norm and I fell into its rhythm, I knew I had
        found 'it'. Like a snowball rolling down a hill, I did my undergrad in
        Computer Science at <a
          href="https://www.ucsc.edu/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">UC Santa Cruz</a
        > and, in the blink of an eye, my Masters in Computer Science at <a
          href="https://www.ucla.edu/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">UCLA</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p class="page-card-text">
        During my free time, I enjoy playing video games, bouldering, and
        tinkering with projects (link to my <a
          href="https://fumoarchive.com"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">latest project</a
        >). I also enjoy learning new things. I'm currently focused on:
        <ul class="page-card-text">
          <li>Studying Japanese</li>
          <li>Expanding my wardrobe</li>
          <li>Staying healthy ^-^</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2 class="gear-section-title">Work</h2>
      <p class="page-card-text">
        I work at <a

          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Roblox</a
        > on the Configurations Team, where we manage multiple critical services (100k+
        requests per second) with high availability and reliability. If you name any
        of Roblox's services, we probably serve the configurations for it.

        Previously, I interned at <a

        Aside from my aforementioned work, I also worked at numerous part-time
        jobs to support myself through college.
